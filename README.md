As someone who values transparency and collaboration in healthcare data interoperability, I'm advocating for the open source development of a Generative AI prompt library specifically for value-based care, with a focus on Medicaid and Medicare line of business.

Generative AI has immense potential to revolutionize healthcare, and many of us are excited about the possibilities it presents. We're all too aware of the heavy administrative burdens that physicians face, and we understand that this burden is a significant factor contributing to burnout among medical professionals. Our goal is to leverage generative AI to enhance physician productivity, allowing them to dedicate more time to what truly matters - providing personalized care to their patients.

To that end, I'm inviting anyone who shares our vision to collaborate with us on this open source initiative - "value-based care AI prompt library". SkyPoint Cloud is committed to providing resources and taking on the role of GitHub maintainer for this project.

Let's take action now to create one of the most valuable tools in value-based care AI - An open source library of Generative AI prompts. Please comment below if anyone is interested.

Together, we can make a meaningful impact on the future of value-based care.
